# python-challenge
#The purpose of this project is to create a python script that helps analyze the data of two datsets: bank budget data & election poll data.

#For the bank budget data, values retrieved from the script:
Total number of months included in the dataset
Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of these changes
The greatest increase in profits over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits over the entire period

#For the election poll data, the following values were retrieved from the script:
Total number of votes cast
Complete list of candidates who received votes
Percentage of votes each candidate won
Total number of votes each candidate won
Winner of each election based on popular vote

#I did get a lot of help in writing the code. In summary I was able to use the learnt skills of how to import modules like csv, how to read and write files in various formats and how to store content in variables and lists.
